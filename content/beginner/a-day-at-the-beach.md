Sarah woke up early on a sunny Saturday morning. She was excited because she was going to spend the day at the beach. She packed her beach bag with all the essentials: sunscreen, a towel, water, and some snacks.

She arrived at the beach early in the morning when the sun was still gentle. The first thing she did was apply sunscreen to protect her skin. The beach was peaceful, with only a few people setting up their umbrellas and chairs.

Sarah spent the morning building sandcastles and collecting seashells. She found many beautiful shells in different colors and shapes. When the sun got higher, she decided to go for a swim. The water was cool and refreshing.

For lunch, she enjoyed her packed sandwich while watching the waves. She saw children playing in the sand and surfers riding the waves. In the afternoon, she read her book under the shade of her umbrella.

As the day came to an end, Sarah watched the beautiful sunset over the ocean. The sky turned orange and pink, creating a magical scene. It had been a perfect day at the beach.
